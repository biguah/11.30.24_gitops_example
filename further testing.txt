AWS Transit Gateway now supports the ability to establish peering connections between Transit Gateways in different AWS Regions. Transit Gateway is a service that enables customers to connect thousands of Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (Amazon VPCs) and their on-premises networks using a single gateway. With AWS Transit Gateway, customers only have to create and manage a single connection from a central regional gateway to each Amazon VPC, on premises data center, or remote office across their networks.
